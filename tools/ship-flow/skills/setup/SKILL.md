description: One-time interactive setup for this plugin in a consuming repo — interviews the user, writes `.claude/ship-flow.config.json`, and installs (or offers to install) a CLAUDE.md constitution, a CI workflow, and branch protection from this plugin's templates/. Use once per repo, when a repo first adopts ship-flow, or when re-running to fill in config that was skipped the first time.

This plugin's skills (`hotfix`, and others as they're added) read `.claude/ship-flow.config.json` at
the consuming repo's root. This skill is how that file — and the repo-level scaffolding it depends on
(a CLAUDE.md, a CI workflow, branch protection) — gets created in the first place.

**This skill is not part of the day-to-day delivery loop.** Run it once when adopting this plugin in a
repo; re-run it later only to fill in something skipped the first time or to change a config value.

## What this plugin can and can't install

A plugin's own root-level `CLAUDE.md` is **not** loaded as project context by Claude Code (confirmed
against the official plugin spec) — so the constitution layer can't just ship inside the plugin and
work automatically. That's why this skill exists: it *copies* a template into the consuming repo's own
`CLAUDE.md`, where it will actually be loaded.

| Can install directly | Needs this skill to copy/patch into place |
|---|---|
| Skills, agents, workflows (this plugin itself) | `CLAUDE.md` (constitution) |
| | CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` or equivalent) |
| | Branch protection (a GitHub API call, not a file) |
| | `turbo.json`/verify-script wiring (repo-specific, example only) |

## Sequence

### 1. Check for existing config
Read `.claude/ship-flow.config.json` if it exists. Reuse its values and the user's requested changes.
Fill missing facts from repository documentation and manifests; preserve unrelated settings. If the
request is a setup review or draft, return the proposed files without installing them.

### 2. Interview
Inspect the repository and session first. Reuse known answers; ask one question at a time only for a
missing decision that affects the setup. Do not make the user restate manifest facts or approve the
same exact setup twice. Resolve these fields:

1. **Branch model**: `git-flow` (a shared integration branch + a release branch, e.g.
   develop→main) or `trunk-based` (a single shared branch). If git-flow: what are the two branch
   names? If trunk-based: what's the one branch name?
2. **Package manager**: what does this repo use (`pnpm`/`npm`/`yarn`/`cargo`/`uv`/other)?
3. **Verify command**: what single command does this repo run to check "is this change good" —
   typecheck+lint+test, or whatever this repo actually has? (If the repo has nothing yet, offer
   `templates/turbo-verify-wiring.example.md` as a starting point — see step 4.) Record the **raw**
   command as-is (e.g. `pnpm verify`), even if this repo already has its own verdict-contract wrapper
   (e.g. `pnpm verdict`) — either way, `ship-feature`/`hotfix` always run it as
   `verdict-run.sh -- <verifyCommand>` (BAC-745), and `verdict-run.sh` reconciles an already-emitted
   verdict contract into one canonical result consistent with the command status. Conflicting or
   missing verdict fields cannot count as PASS. Don't write `verdict-run.sh`
   itself into this field.
4. **Project name**: what should the `CLAUDE.md` template call this repo?
5. **Issue tracker** (optional): does this repo use an external tracker (Linear, Jira, bare GitHub
   Issues, none)? Only asked if relevant — don't force an answer if the repo has no tracker at all.
6. **Output language**: which language should this repo's agents write prose in — reports, summaries,
   PR bodies, tracked-issue comments? **Infer a default first rather than asking cold**
   — reuse an explicit preference without asking again. Otherwise the user's language is a reversible
   default; disclose it in the result. The language used in this session is the strongest signal, and an
   existing `CLAUDE.md`, README, recent commit messages, or tracked-issue titles corroborate it. Present
   what you inferred and let the user correct it. Record it as `outputLanguage`, a **BCP-47 tag** (`ko`, `ja`, `en`, `pt-BR`), not a
   language name — a tag has one spelling, "Korean"/"korean"/"한국어" have three.

Write answers into `.claude/ship-flow.config.json` as you go (don't wait until the end — a skill that
dies partway through step 3 shouldn't lose steps 1-2's answers):

```json
{
  "branchModel": "git-flow",
  "integrationBranch": "develop",
  "releaseBranch": "main",
  "packageManager": "pnpm",
  "verifyCommand": "pnpm verify",
  "projectName": "my-project",
  "trackerName": "Linear",
  "trackerDoc": "docs/agents/issue-tracker.md",
  "pluginBinPrefix": "",
  "outputLanguage": "ko"
}
```

(`integrationBranch`/`ciSkipOnIntegrationPR`/`deployHook` are `hotfix`'s existing fields — leave them
as `hotfix`'s own doc describes if this is a fresh file. `trunk-based` repos omit `integrationBranch`.)

**`outputLanguage` is the one field a re-run should always check for.** Every ship-flow skill and agent
opens with an output-language banner that reads this key; with the key missing they fall back to
whatever language the current conversation is in, which holds early in a session and then drifts as
long English skill bodies come to dominate the context — the observed failure is a run that plans and
reviews in the user's language and then reports its PR in English (or, once, in a third language
nobody asked for). Writing the key is what removes the guessing. It is **prose language only**: code,
commands, flags, identifiers, paths, branch names, and quoted tool output are never translated, and
`verifyCommand`/`pluginBinPrefix`/branch names in this same config are values, not prose.

**`pluginBinPrefix` — don't skip this one.** It's what turns every loop-engine bin command in
`ship-feature`/`hotfix`/`retrospect`/`deps-audit` from a description into a string an agent can actually
run: those skills write commands as `{{pluginBinPrefix}}<script>` and substitute this value, concatenated
onto the script name **with no separator** (so a value needing a space or slash carries its own trailing
one). Derive it from the active runtime's verified resolver or PATH, not an assumed installation:

| Situation | Value |
|---|---|
| Required bin commands have been verified on PATH in this runtime | `""` |
| This repo already has its own resolver wrapper | `node tools/plugin-path.mjs exec bin/` (or whatever its real path is) |
| Skills also need to run headless (CI, a cron shell) where nothing is on PATH | `node "$LOOP_ENGINE_PATH/bin/plugin-path.mjs" exec bin/`, paired with the `setup-loop-engine` action from step 4 |

If resolution fails, report the missing capability and leave execution-dependent setup incomplete.
Do not claim an empty prefix works, install a plugin, or activate hooks to repair it without scope.
Resolve `ship-flow` and `loop-engine` independently with the available `plugin-path.mjs resolve
<plugin>` command (or the caller's verified equivalent). In the steps below, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`
means the resolved **ship-flow** root; bind that root explicitly in runtimes without this variable.

### 2a. Record tracker operations and role mapping

When tracker setup is in scope, create or update `trackerDoc` at the established integration-doc path,
or `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` by default. `trackerDoc` is an optional discovery field; older repos
without it keep using their established doc. Record verified tracker/repository/team/project IDs,
read/create/update/comment operations supported by the available tool, PRD grouping rules, issue-id
format, and the mapping from canonical roles (`bug`, `enhancement`, `needs-triage`, `needs-info`,
`ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`) to actual labels/states. Mark missing roles unresolved;
never invent or create labels just to complete this table. Record the authorized human owner only
when their identity is established; an authenticated service/shared account is not the user's identity.

For no tracker, record that choice and the local spec/review route. For unresolved mapping, local
drafting and review can continue; only the affected tracker mutation waits. Creating labels, projects,
issues or comments requires the corresponding publication scope, beyond writing this local doc.

### 3. Install `CLAUDE.md`
Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/CLAUDE.md.template`, substitute every `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` with the
interview's answers (see the template's own placeholder list at its end for what's expected), and
write the result to the consuming repo's `CLAUDE.md`.

**If a `CLAUDE.md` already exists**: don't overwrite it silently. Show the user a diff-style summary of
what the template would add/change. Apply an already-authorized merge or replacement; otherwise ask
only for a conflicting content choice after preparing the concrete diff.

### 4. CI + turbo wiring (optional scope)
Prepare the requested CI changes before asking for any missing installation decision. Reuse explicit
setup scope; do not ask again for already-authorized installation. A starting workflow comes from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/ci.yml.template`
(substituting `{{RELEASE_BRANCH}}` and `{{VERIFY_COMMAND}}` from the config) at
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`. If the repo already has a CI workflow, don't overwrite it — point out
`templates/ci.yml.template`'s `ci-gate` pattern (the always-run aggregator, and why it exists) as
something worth adopting into their existing workflow instead, and stop there.

If the repo is (or will be) a turbo monorepo with no verify wiring yet, point at
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/turbo-verify-wiring.example.md` as a starting point — this one is
reference material to adapt by hand, not something this skill copies verbatim (task names vary too
much repo to repo to template safely).

If any CI job in this repo needs to invoke a loop-engine or ship-flow bin script directly (a PR gate
running `classify-risk.sh`/`ac-verify.sh`, or a repo-local harness self-test) — ask whether to
install `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/setup-loop-engine.action.yml.template` at
`.github/actions/setup-loop-engine/action.yml` (BAC-753), substituting `{{LOOP_ENGINE_TAG}}`/
`{{SHIP_FLOW_TAG}}` with the plugin versions this repo currently targets (`vX.Y.Z`, optionally with
build metadata; match `minPluginVersions` if present). Also substitute `{{LOOP_ENGINE_COMMIT}}` and
`{{SHIP_FLOW_COMMIT}}` with separately reviewed, full 40-character lowercase commit SHAs from the
canonical `reach0908/paul-loop` release history. Peel annotated tags to their commit, not the tag
object. Check the release's review and same-commit validation evidence; a current remote tag lookup
alone is not evidence that a changed target is trusted. Commit the selected tag/SHA pairs in the
consumer action and review both on updates; never compute expected SHAs from live refs during CI.
Validate all four values before substitution: literal release versions and hex SHAs only, no quotes,
newlines, shell text or GitHub expressions. Missing pins are a setup gap; do not substitute a branch
or fall back to tag-only execution. The action verifies both clones before checkout or downloaded
code execution, then retains manifest validation. Existing copied actions need an explicitly scoped
update; a provider release does not rewrite them. GitHub Actions is a plain shell
process outside the live-session plugin cache, so any such job needs this action's
`LOOP_ENGINE_PATH`/`SHIP_FLOW_PATH` exports before loop-engine's bundled `bin/plugin-path.mjs`
resolver (or a bin script invoked directly) can find anything.

For `git-flow` repos, also offer `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/loop-selftest.yml.template` as a
`{integrationBranch}`-PR backstop for harness/policy changes that `ci.yml` never sees (git-flow's
feature→integration PRs skip `ci.yml`'s trigger entirely — see `ci.yml.template`'s own comments).
Like `turbo-verify-wiring.example.md`, this one is reference material to adapt by hand — the actual
policy paths and selftest command are this repo's own, not something to copy verbatim.

Also offer the commented-out `hygiene` job in `ci.yml.template` (BAC-754) — three cheap, dependency-free
static gates from loop-engine's own `bin/`: `check-docs-hygiene.mjs` (ADR numbering/README index/
dangling-reference/SKILL.md word cap), `check-pr-hygiene.mjs` (PR body must reference a tracker id —
ask whether this repo's id format needs `--pattern` beyond the generic "LETTERS-digits" default), and
`check-module-size.mjs` (module-size ratchet — needs `tools/module-size-baseline.json` committed for
first adoption, or defaults to a bare threshold with no per-module entries). All three need the
`setup-loop-engine` action from step 4 above; skip offering this job if that action wasn't installed.

If this repo's tracker id format needs a non-default `check-pr-hygiene.mjs` pattern, note it in
`.claude/ship-flow.config.json` (e.g. a `trackerIdPattern` field) so it stays discoverable alongside
the rest of this repo's ship-flow config, and pass it through wherever `check-pr-hygiene.mjs` is
invoked (the `ci.yml` job above, and `ship-feature`/`publisher`'s own PR-body composition step, if this
repo wants the same check enforced before a PR is even opened).

Offer the resolved **loop-engine** plugin's `templates/risk-rules.example.json` too, if this repo doesn't already have a
`risk-rules.json` at its root — `classify-risk.mjs` ships zero product-specific rules on purpose
(BAC-698/BAC-563 C5), so without one, this plugin's risk gating only ever sees its structural baselines
(docs-only, low-file-count, etc.) and every domain-specific path (migrations, auth, outbound sends) goes
unclassified. This is reference material to adapt by hand, not something to copy verbatim — every
placeholder path needs replacing with this repo's real ones. Point out that the template's `harness`
rule is self-covering by design (it matches `risk-rules.json` itself, so silently weakening a rule and
the file that defines rules in the same PR still gets flagged) — the copy should keep that property, not
drop it while filling in the other placeholders.

Resolve that sibling plugin with `plugin-path.mjs resolve loop-engine` using the verified resolver
from step 2, and read `templates/risk-rules.example.json` under the returned root. It is not under
ship-flow's `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`. An unresolved sibling is a reported setup gap, not permission
to fabricate a path or silently copy a different template.

### 5. Review a branch-protection plan, then apply only its approved content

The helper defaults to a read-only remote **plan**. Local plan output is allowed within setup's file
scope. Prepare one plan per requested branch with the resolved ship-flow helper, for example:

```bash
"$SHIP_FLOW_PATH/templates/branch-protect.sh" owner/repo main --require-pr --required-check selftest --output reviewed.json
```

Read the complete JSON, including existing and desired protection, target repo/branch and `plan_hash`.
Show the concrete delta before requesting any missing approval for this remote setting change.
Reuse approval only for this exact reviewed plan and target. A setup request or green CI alone is
not branch-protection approval. Apply with the actual reviewed SHA-256 value:

```bash
"$SHIP_FLOW_PATH/templates/branch-protect.sh" --apply-plan reviewed.json --approve-plan <sha256>
```

The helper rechecks the plan hash and current protection before applying. Drift requires a fresh
plan/review; do not bypass the recheck or silently weaken unspecified restrictions. Confirm the remote
result before reporting protection installed. Legacy direct-mutation invocations now only prepare
plans; the explicit apply-plan/hash pair is required for mutation. Never infer approval across branches.

### 6. Confirm
Report what was installed/changed and what was skipped (and why — e.g. "CLAUDE.md already existed, so
I left it — here's what the template would have added"). If anything from steps 3-5 was skipped, say
so explicitly rather than letting the user assume everything happened.

## If this repo already had local skills with the same names

Plugin skills are namespaced by the platform (`plugin:skill`, not a bare name); if this repo used to
invoke a same-named local skill directly (e.g. `/ship-feature`), there's no compat shim to fall back
on — every live reference has to be updated in the same pass (CLAUDE.md, `docs/agents/*`, other skill
bodies; leave `.loop/lessons/*.json` and other historical records alone). One sweep habit catches what a
narrower one misses:
- After a bulk find-and-replace, grep the **raw renamed substring** across each touched file, not just
  the specific quoting/escaping form your edit targeted — the same string can appear a second time in a
  different escaping (e.g. a plain backtick in a single-quoted string vs. an escaped backtick inside a
  template literal), and a `replace_all` on one form silently leaves the other.

## Testing this skill itself

If you're validating this skill's own correctness (not running it for a real repo): run it against a
genuinely empty scratch repository (a fresh `git init`, nothing else) and confirm that after it
finishes, a real verify-like gate actually runs and exits non-zero on a deliberately broken change —
that's the concrete, checkable version of "the interview actually produced a working setup," not just
"the files got written."
