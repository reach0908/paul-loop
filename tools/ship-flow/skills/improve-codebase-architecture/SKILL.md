# Improve Codebase Architecture

> **Output language.** Read `outputLanguage` (a BCP-47 tag, e.g. `ko`) from
> `.claude/ship-flow.config.json` and write **every human-facing prose artifact** — reports, summaries,
> questions, PR and tracked-issue bodies, your final message — in that language. **Code, commands, flags,
> identifiers, file paths, branch names, and quoted tool output stay verbatim; never translate them.** Key
> absent or unreadable → fall back to the language the user is writing in; never error on this.

Surface architectural friction and propose **deepening opportunities** — refactors that turn shallow modules into deep ones. The aim is testability and AI-navigability.

## Vocabulary

Call the Skill tool with "codebase-design" for the architecture vocabulary (**module**, **interface**,
**depth**, **seam**, **adapter**, **leverage**, **locality**) and its principles (the deletion test,
"the interface is the test surface", "one adapter = hypothetical seam, two = real"). Use those terms
exactly in every suggestion, and don't drift into "component," "service," "API," or "boundary."

This skill is _informed_ by the project's domain model. The domain language gives names to good seams;
ADRs record decisions the skill should not re-litigate.

## Process

### 1. Explore

**Scope before you scan — YAGNI.** Deepening a module pays off by making future changes to it easier, so put extra weight on the parts of the codebase that have recently changed. Decide *where* to look before you look:

- If the user named a direction — a module, a subsystem, a pain point — take it, and skip the inference below.
- Otherwise, walk back a good stretch of the commit history (`git log --oneline`) to find the codebase's hot spots — the files and areas that keep coming up — and let those paths pull your attention first. If the changes are scattered with no clear hot spot, widen the net.

Read the project's domain glossary and any ADRs in the area you're touching first.

Then use the Agent tool with `subagent_type=Explore` to walk the codebase. Don't follow rigid heuristics — explore organically and note where you experience friction:

- Where does understanding one concept require bouncing between many small modules?
- Where are modules **shallow** — interface nearly as complex as the implementation?
- Where have pure functions been extracted just for testability, but the real bugs hide in how they're called (no **locality**)?
- Where do tightly-coupled modules leak across their seams?
- Which parts of the codebase are untested, or hard to test through their current interface?

Apply the **deletion test** to anything you suspect is shallow: would deleting it concentrate complexity, or just move it? A "yes, concentrates" is the signal you want.

### 2. Present candidates as an HTML report

Write a self-contained HTML file to the OS temp directory so nothing lands in the repo. Resolve the temp dir from `$TMPDIR`, falling back to `/tmp` (or `%TEMP%` on Windows), and write to `<tmpdir>/architecture-review-<timestamp>.html` so each run gets a fresh file. Open it for the user — `xdg-open <path>` on Linux, `open <path>` on macOS, `start <path>` on Windows — and tell them the absolute path.

The report uses **Tailwind via CDN** for layout and styling, and **Mermaid via CDN** for diagrams where a graph/flow/sequence reliably communicates the structure. Mix Mermaid with hand-crafted CSS/SVG visuals — use Mermaid when relationships are graph-shaped (call graphs, dependencies, sequences), and hand-built divs/SVG when you want something more editorial (mass diagrams, cross-sections, collapse animations). Each candidate gets a **before/after visualisation**. Be visual.

For each candidate, the same template as before, but rendered as a card:

- **Files** — which files/modules are involved
- **Problem** — why the current architecture is causing friction
- **Solution** — plain-language description in `outputLanguage` of what would change
- **Benefits** — explained in terms of locality and leverage, and how tests would improve
- **Before / After diagram** — side-by-side, custom-drawn, illustrating the shallowness and the deepening
- **Recommendation strength** — one of `Strong`, `Worth exploring`, `Speculative`, rendered as a badge

End the report with a **Top recommendation** section: which candidate you'd tackle first and why.

**Use `CONTEXT.md` vocabulary for the domain, and the `paul-loop:codebase-design` vocabulary for the architecture.** If `CONTEXT.md` defines "Order," talk about "the Order intake module" — not "the FooBarHandler," and not "the Order service."

**ADR conflicts**: if a candidate contradicts an existing ADR, only surface it when the friction is real enough to warrant revisiting the ADR. Mark it clearly in the card (e.g. a warning callout: _"contradicts ADR-0007 — but worth reopening because…"_). Don't list every theoretical refactor an ADR forbids.

See [HTML-REPORT.md](HTML-REPORT.md) for the full HTML scaffold, diagram patterns, and styling guidance.

For an exploration request, return the concrete opportunity report before asking for a missing
choice. If the caller already selected an opportunity or authorized its bounded implementation, reuse
that scope and continue. A read-only repository review may create the requested isolated temporary
HTML report without editing the repo. If the user forbids all writes or that artifact write, return
the report in the conversation. Interface design follows the selected scope; exploration alone is not implementation
or publication authorization.

### 3. Grilling loop

Once the user picks a candidate, call the Skill tool with "grilling" to walk the design tree with them — constraints, dependencies, the shape of the deepened module, what sits behind the seam, what tests survive.

Classify the candidate's dependencies before proposing a shape — the category decides whether a port is warranted and how the deepened module gets tested across its seam. See [DEEPENING.md](../codebase-design/DEEPENING.md) for the four dependency categories, seam discipline (one adapter = hypothetical seam), and the replace-don't-layer testing strategy.

Side effects happen inline as decisions crystallize:

- **Naming a deepened module after a concept not in `CONTEXT.md`?** Call the Skill tool with "domain-modeling" and add the term to `CONTEXT.md` in its format. Create the file lazily if it doesn't exist.
- **Sharpening a fuzzy term during the conversation?** Update `CONTEXT.md` right there.
- **User rejects the candidate with a load-bearing reason?** Offer an ADR, framed as: _"Want me to record this as an ADR so future architecture reviews don't re-suggest it?"_ Only offer when the reason would actually be needed by a future explorer to avoid re-suggesting the same thing — skip ephemeral reasons ("not worth it right now") and self-evident ones. Call the Skill tool with "domain-modeling" for the ADR format and the bar for offering one.
- **Want to explore alternative interfaces for the deepened module?** Call the Skill tool with "codebase-design" and use its [INTERFACE-DESIGN.md](../codebase-design/INTERFACE-DESIGN.md) design-it-twice pattern.
