# AC contracts — syntax reference

The one-line acceptance-criterion format that makes `ship-feature` step 3's runtime-verify gate
machine-checkable instead of self-reported (ADR-0104). `SKILL.md` step 1 states the requirement;
this file is the format. Read it while writing the plan.

## Syntax

Quoted verbatim — this matches `ac-verify.sh`'s parser exactly. An optional leading markdown list
marker (`- `) is tolerated.

```
AC: <description> | verify: <command> | artifacts: <path1>,<path2> | expect: <substring>
```

- Only `AC: <description>` is required.
- `verify:`, `artifacts:`, and `expect:` are each **optional** and may appear in **any order**.
- One combination is rejected: **`expect:` alone**, with neither `verify:` nor `artifacts:`. It has
  nothing to search, so `ac-verify.sh` reports it as a contract error (exit 2), not as a failing AC.
- Fields are separated by ` | ` (space-pipe-space).
- `artifacts:` paths are **comma-separated**, not space-separated — a path may itself contain
  spaces, so spaces cannot be the separator.

## Field semantics

| Field | What `ac-verify.sh` does with it |
|---|---|
| `verify:` | Runs the command as a subprocess; a zero exit code passes |
| `artifacts:` | Checks each listed path exists after the run |
| `expect:` | Checks that this literal substring appears in the AC's corpus — see below |

Each is a deterministic subprocess judgment, which is the point: the gate's result doesn't depend on
the agent's own account of whether the feature works.

**Which corpus `expect:` searches** depends on what else the AC declares:

| The AC declares | `expect:` searches |
|---|---|
| `verify:` (with or without `artifacts:`) | the `verify:` command's output |
| `artifacts:`, no `verify:` | the contents of those files (a directory is searched recursively; a match in **any** listed artifact satisfies it) |
| neither | nothing — contract error, exit 2 |

When both `verify:` and `artifacts:` are present, `expect:` searches the **output only**. That is
deliberate: a contract you wrote against a command's output keeps meaning exactly that, and never
starts passing because the substring happened to appear in a file.

A documentation contract therefore reads naturally — no `verify:` needed:

```
AC: the skill states that forked entries are excluded from bulk backports | artifacts: skills/vendor-sync/SKILL.md | expect: fork
```

## Examples

A behavioural check with an expected substring in the output:

```
AC: login rejects a wrong password | verify: pnpm --filter api test -- auth.spec.ts | expect: 401
```

A check that a build actually produced something:

```
AC: the CLI builds a standalone binary | verify: pnpm build | artifacts: dist/cli,dist/cli.map
```

Description only — legitimate for criteria a human has to eyeball, as long as the plan carries at
least one contracted AC elsewhere:

```
AC: the empty-state illustration is not clipped on a 320px viewport
```

## The floor, and why it exists

For a `standard` or `risky` track — anything with a runtime surface; `docs-only` is exempt because
step 3 is already skipped for it — **the plan as a whole must express at least one AC with a
machine-checkable contract** (a `verify:` field, and/or `artifacts:`/`expect:`).

Not every AC needs one. But **zero across the whole plan** means step 3's `ac-verify.sh` gate has
nothing to evaluate, so it would pass vacuously — a green gate proving nothing. That is why the
`paul-loop:planner` agent fail-closed-checks this before any code exists, and why step 3 fails
closed rather than skipping when a `standard`/`risky` plan has no contracted AC.
