# ship-flow executable-contract guard — the forensic audit of 12 real ship-feature runs (2026-08-24)
# found the skill's mandated deterministic tools executed 0/12 times. Root cause: the skill wrote its
# commands as *description* ("<however this repo invokes its installed loop-engine plugin's bin
# scripts> verdict-run.sh -- ...") rather than as a string an agent could run, so every run silently
# fell back to the raw verify command it already knew. Secondary damage from the same prose form:
# 4 runs pasted a spurious `--` into classify-risk.sh and got a usage error.
#
# Like verdict-wrap-required.test.sh and skill-guard-prose-wiring.test.sh, this is a TEXT-LEVEL
# regression guard on skill prose. It cannot prove an agent obeyed an instruction — only that the
# instruction hasn't quietly reverted to the shape that provably wasn't obeyable. Everything asserted
# here is a mechanical property of the file (a token is present, a wrong argument form is absent), not
# a judgement about wording.
