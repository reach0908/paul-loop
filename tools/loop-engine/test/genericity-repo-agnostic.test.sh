# Regression test for the plugin's stated design contract: loop-engine ships NO product-specific
# rules and is parameterized by the consuming repo's own `.claude/ship-flow.config.json`.
#
# Two runtime surfaces had drifted out of that contract by hardcoding the repo this harness first
# grew in. Both are locked here behaviourally — the default path, the configured path, and (for the
# default) the absence of any invented repo-specific command.
#
#   1) `lessons recall` MISS hint. It told every consuming repo to run
#      `pnpm --filter @glucofit-partners/loop-memory recall …` — a command that exists in exactly one
#      repo on earth. A user-facing instruction that is wrong for everyone else is worse than no
#      instruction: it sends them to a shell error instead of to their own semantic store. Now the
#      command comes from `semanticRecallCommand`, and without config the hint names that key rather
#      than inventing an invocation.
#
#   2) `H1_EXCLUDED_SURFACES` send tokens (lib/boundary-surfaces.mjs). This one is not merely
#      cosmetic. That module exists so the "reduce human interventions" metric cannot optimise away
#      the human-approval boundary itself — merge/deploy/send must be excluded from H1. Its `send`
#      regex was one repo's outbound vocabulary, so in ANY other repo no send command ever matched
#      and the exact failure the module was written to prevent stayed wide open, silently. Now a
#      consuming repo declares its own vocabulary via `sendSurfacePattern`, which EXTENDS (never
#      replaces) the built-in rules — over-exclusion is the safe direction for a metrics filter.
