# Three findings from the security audit that share one shape: a value the code treats as inert is
# actually load-bearing, and nothing in the suite disagreed.
#
#   M2  protect-during-loop.mjs — the mutation-verb list omitted `ln`, and the repo-relative path was
#       computed lexically. Either one alone lets a fixer rewrite a protected file: `ln -sf` replaces
#       its content with no listed verb. (The audit also flagged the lexical `relative()` fallback as
#       a symlink bypass; measured, it is not — worktree re-rooting resolves the symlink through git
#       before that line runs. The case is pinned below rather than fixed, since there was no defect.)
#   M4  tcp-reachable.mjs — the two failure paths returned the raw connection string as `label`, and
#       loop-doctor-heartbeat.mjs prints `label` straight into an agent's SessionStart context. That
#       string is `postgres://user:password@host/db`.
#   M6  ledger-append.mjs — `--run-id` becomes a filename with no validation, so it is a path.
#
# Each is written against the property, not the payload: "no mutation verb reaches a protected file",
# "no output field carries credentials", "a run id cannot be a path".
