# Gate: a plugin's tree must not differ from its own last-published tag while its version stays put.
#
# `tag-on-publish.yml` closed "a released version has no tag". This closes the level below it: a
# plugin file EDITED without bumping that plugin's version. The edit merges, CI is green, the
# marketplace serves the same version number as before — and the change never reaches a single
# consumer, because a manifest only travels on a NEW version.
#
# Measured 2026-09-02 (PR #90 → #91): loop-engine went to 0.14.0 and every dependent's range was
# widened to `^0.14.0`, loop-memory's manifest included — but loop-memory stayed at 0.6.2. The
# marketplace kept serving 0.6.2, which still declared `^0.13.0`, so loop-engine 0.14.0 became
# unresolvable for everyone:
#   claude plugin update loop-engine@paul-loop
#   ✔ Skipped — conflicting version requirements (no version satisfies all of: ^0.13.0, ^0.14.0)
# A checkmark on a no-op. `plugin-dep-range.test.sh` passed throughout and was right to: it checks
# that the ranges in THIS TREE admit the loop-engine THIS TREE ships, and after the edit they did.
# It has no reach into "an edit that never ships". Nothing else looked either.
#
# The check: for each plugin the marketplace lists, if tag `<name>--v<version>` already exists then
# that exact version is already published — so the plugin's subtree must be byte-identical to what
# that tag holds. Any difference means the working tree is shipping under a version number that
# already means something else. Bump the version (which has no tag yet, so this check goes quiet
# until it is published).
#
# Fail-closed on a missing tag universe: with no `*--v*` tags visible at all (shallow clone, tags
# not fetched) this gate would pass on everything while checking nothing — the exact silence it
# exists to end. It errors instead and says how to fix it.
