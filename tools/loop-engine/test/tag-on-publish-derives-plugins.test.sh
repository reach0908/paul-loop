# inside it reintroduces the same failure one level down — add a fourth plugin, forget to edit this
# workflow, and that plugin's releases go untagged with everything still green. So the property under
# test is not "the workflow mentions three names", it is "the workflow finds whatever is in the
# manifest".
#
# This runs the workflow's actual shell body against a sandbox repo rather than grepping it. Grep
# would pass on a workflow that reads the manifest and then ignores it.
