// gate-risky-commands.mjs — PreToolUse(Bash) guardrail: enforces "merge and deploy always require a
// human, regardless of risk classification" at the tool-call boundary, not just in skill prose.
//
// Why a hook (two structural holes in skill-level prose gates): (1) gate.mjs's exit 10 is non-blocking
// under the Claude Code hooks contract — only exit 2, or exit 0 + JSON (permissionDecision), block.
// (2) skill-level gates leak from subagents/bypassPermissions — a PreToolUse hook fires in both of
// those contexts too (official docs).
//
// Single decision point: this hook doesn't decide AUTO vs REQUIRE itself. Its own scope filter answers
// only "is this command a merge/deploy surface" (gh pr merge · a repo's deploy-script path · its
// deploy/redeploy package-manager aliases). Once a surface is confirmed, it mirrors
// bin/classify-risk.mjs --command --stage merge|deploy (-> gate.mjs) and mirrors its exit code
// (10 = REQUIRE -> ask/deny, 0 = AUTO -> defer). The classification table is never duplicated — change the
// rules in one place (classify-risk) and every consumer follows.
//
// deny vs ask: default is "ask" — REQUIRE means human approval, not prohibition. A consuming repo's
// permissions.ask rules can already route the same surface to interactive approval and, per official
// docs, already survive compound commands and env-var prefixes. What this hook adds on top:
// (1) detection beyond string rules — env/nohup/nice/command/sudo/time word prefixes, whitespace
//     variants (via the shared tokenizer), and gh/pnpm global-flag traversal (firstSubcommand)
// (2) a single source of truth for the verdict — mirrors classify-risk, with the matched rule
//     surfaced in the reason
// (3) a bypassPermissions deny backstop (below) (4) red-events telemetry.
// "ask" is a valid PreToolUse hookSpecificOutput value (official hooks doc). Headless sessions can't
// prompt, so ask resolves to a fail-closed rejection there (intended). In bypassPermissions mode this
// hook denies rather than asks: official docs say an *explicit* ask rule still forces a prompt even in
// that mode, but how a hook-returned "ask" behaves there is undocumented, so this hook doesn't rely on
// undocumented behavior and fails closed instead.
//
// fail-open/fail-closed (same principle as gate-before-merge): the detection stage (stdin parse,
// non-Bash, tokenizing, "not a target surface") fails open (defer — the permissions.ask layer still
// applies); once a surface is confirmed (including the classify-risk spawn and its verdict), it fails
// closed.
//
// This hook is a guardrail, not a boundary (see the repo-wide threat-model ADR that applies to this
// harness) — the tokenizer can't emulate eval/bash -c/quoting/node -e, and finding a bypass isn't a
// bug (parser hardening is a won't-fix). The real boundary: server-side branch protection for merges,
// human-approval practice for deploys. Don't read this as "merges are now blocked."
