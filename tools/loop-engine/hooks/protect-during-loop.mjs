// PreToolUse guard — reward-hacking defense: blocks **Edit/Write/MultiEdit (file paths), Codex apply_patch and Bash
// (shell mutation)** against files that decide the verifier's outcome (a consuming repo's
// `.loop/protect.globs`), at the harness level.
//
// Arming is structural, not prose: relying only on a `.loop/looping` sentinel (touched by the loop
// being watched, i.e. by the very agent it's meant to constrain) leaves the guard silently off
// whenever context gets compacted and the agent forgets to arm it. Armed state is decided by a shared
// judge (lib/protect-globs.mjs `guardState`):
//   armed = `.loop/looping` present (owned by loop-fix.sh — takes priority over guard-off)
//        OR (on a working branch, outside the consuming repo's protected-branch set, AND no valid
//            `.loop/guard-off`)
// Legitimate edits to protected files (writing a failing TDD test, touching package.json/turbo.json)
// escape via: `echo '<reason>' > .loop/guard-off` (empty file is invalid; TTL 30 min — prevents a
// permanent off-switch) -> edit -> `rm -f .loop/guard-off`, with the reason recorded in the PR body.
//
// Bash channel: what a shell touches is undecidable in general -> a conservative coarse net. Blocks
// only when a command (a) looks mutating (rm/mv/cp/sed -i/redirection/etc.) AND (b) contains a token
// that hits a protected glob. Pure reads (cat/grep/pnpm test/etc.) pass through. The real boundary is
// PR review, not this hook.
//
// Rooting: arming and glob matching are judged at the *target's* worktree, not the session's
// CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR (BAC-785) — see the effective-root block below. On the Bash channel "the target"
// can only mean the session's cwd (what a shell touches is undecidable), so that channel is rooted at
// cwd's worktree — a coarser net, in keeping with it being a guardrail and not a boundary.
//
// fail-open: internal error / non-git / detached -> allow (never wedge the session).
