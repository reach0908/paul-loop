# loop-fix.sh — Phase 1 of loop-engine: the closed verify -> fix loop.
#
# "Ralph is a Bash loop." This is that loop, made disciplined:
#   verify (ground truth) -> PASS? done : hand structured failures to a fixer -> repeat
#   until PASS, or a hard stopping criterion fires.
#
# It encodes the loop-engineering findings:
#   - The VERIFIER is the ceiling. The verdict comes from verify-cmd's exit code, period.
#   - GENERATOR != EVALUATOR. The fixer never decides success; only the verifier does.
#   - HARD STOPPING CRITERIA. --max-iter (always), optional --budget-sec, stall detection.
#   - NO REWARD HACKING. --protect snapshots verifier/test files; if a fix mutates them, restore
#     them to their pre-run bytes and abort.
#   - FILE-BASED HANDOFF. Each iteration writes the verdict, log, and a fix prompt to .loop/.
#
# Usage:
#   loop-fix.sh --verify "<cmd>" --fix "<cmd>" [options]
#
# Required:
#   --verify "<cmd>"    Command whose exit code is ground truth. Run via `sh -c`, so normal
#                       shell quoting works (e.g. --verify 'node --test "a b.mjs"').
#   --fix    "<cmd>"    Command that attempts a fix. Run once per failing iteration with the
#                       workspace as cwd, via `sh -c`. Reads $LOOP_PROMPT_FILE / $LOOP_VERDICT_FILE
#                       / $LOOP_LOG_FILE. For real use, wrap an agent (e.g. claude -p). For tests,
#                       a deterministic script. If omitted, runs verify-only (stops at first FAIL).
# Options:
#   --max-iter <n>      Hard iteration cap (default 10). The primary safety net.
#   --budget-sec <s>    Wall-clock budget; 0 = unlimited (default 0).
#   --stall <n>         Abort once the failure signature has been identical n iterations running
#                       (default 3). Heuristic — see "Stall caveat" below. Dual-signal (BAC-626 ①):
#                       a stall only counts when the failure fingerprint (EXIT+FAIL lines) is
#                       identical AND the summed pass/fail counts from the log did not move; moving
#                       counts reset the counter ("same message, moving counts" is progress). If no
#                       counts are extractable, fingerprint-only (previous behaviour).
#   --infra-retries <n|off>  Transient infra failures do NOT consume --max-iter: the iteration is
#                       exempt and verify is retried, up to n exemptions (default 2); one more infra
#                       failure past the cap aborts (exit 1). Classified as infra ONLY when a docker
#                       daemon/port signature is in the log AND no runner failure marker (FAILED,
#                       not ok, AssertionError, …) is present — tests that actually ran and failed
#                       are never exempted. 'off' disables the classifier entirely (pre-BAC-626
#                       behaviour: every FAIL goes to the fixer). n=0 aborts on the first infra
#                       failure. Exempt iterations spawn no fixer, never seed the lessons
#                       signature, and still honour --budget-sec.
#   --guard-mutation    Passed through to verdict-run.sh: verify must not change git-visible state,
#                       otherwise the verdict is forced FAIL (see verdict-run.sh, BAC-626 ④).
#   --idle-timeout-sec <n>      Material-progress watchdog (BAC-626 ③; opt-in, default 0=off).
#                       Kills the loop's whole descendant process tree and aborts (exit 1) when
#                       NEITHER the run-event ledger (.loop/runs/<current>.jsonl, BAC-570) NOR the
#                       verify log grows for n seconds ("activity = any log", so a long healthy
#                       verify that keeps writing output is never killed). LOOP_RUN_LEDGER
#                       overrides the ledger path (test seam).
#   --progress-timeout-sec <n>  Second clock of the same watchdog: aborts when no MATERIAL progress
#                       event (a new verdict.* entry in the ledger) lands for n seconds while mere
#                       activity may continue. Recommended ops values: idle 600 / no-progress 1800.
#                       Caveat: when loop-fix itself runs under an outer verdict-run wrapper, the
#                       inherited VERDICT_RUN_LEDGER_NESTED marker suppresses nested ledger appends
#                       — the progress clock can then fire on a healthy loop (a warning is logged
#                       at watchdog start; prefer the idle clock in that composition).
#   --protect <glob>    File(s) the fixer must NOT modify (repeatable). Reward-hacking guard.
#                       A pattern containing '**' recurses (resolved via `find`, skipping
#                       node_modules/.git, and $LOOP_DIR itself so the guard's own backup copies
#                       never self-match a broad glob like '**/*.test.*'); otherwise it is a
#                       single-level glob or a literal path. If a --protect pattern matches ZERO
#                       files, the loop refuses to run (exit 2) rather than silently leaving the
#                       guard off. Every check_protected() call that comes back clean is followed by
#                       a bounded grace-period recheck (PROTECT_GRACE_SEC, default 1.5s, override via
#                       env var LOOP_PROTECT_GRACE_SEC — mainly a test-speed knob) before being
#                       trusted — see round-5 in Guard scope below for why, and what this does and
#                       does NOT guarantee.
#   --loop-dir <dir>    State/handoff dir (default .loop).
#   --resume <run-id>   Resume an interrupted/cancelled execution with original limits and HEAD.
#                       With no other flags, reuse its exact command/config. Budgets include downtime.
#                       Node supervises process groups and keeps .loop/lifecycle/<id>.json; concurrent
#                       executions in one workspace or handoff directory are refused (exit 2).
#                       SIGINT/SIGTERM exit 130, invalidate PASS, recover protected files and kill the
#                       worker group before releasing the sentinel. This is not containment of a child
#                       deliberately escaping its process group. SIGKILL needs explicit stale recovery.
#   --lessons <dir>     Verified-lessons memory (Phase 3): recall past fixes for this same failure
#                       into the fix prompt, and record a VERIFIED lesson on success. See bin/lessons.mjs.
#
# Exit: 0 = reached PASS. 1 = budget/iter/stall/infra/timeout exhausted. 2 = usage error / protect
#       matched nothing / verdict-run itself refused (exit 2 — e.g. --guard-mutation outside git).
#       3 = protected file mutated (restore attempted — see Guard scope below for what "restore"
#       actually guarantees). 4 = refused to start: a PRIOR run's restore could not verify its own
#       integrity and left $LOOP_DIR/protect-compromised behind — a human must inspect and clear it
#       before retrying (see Guard scope below).
#
# Guard scope (read this — the guarantee is narrow): --protect aborts (exit 3) when a file that
# existed at start AND was matched by --protect is edited or deleted. It does NOT cover files not
# listed, or other inputs the verifier reads (fixtures, snapshots, config like
# vitest.config/conftest.py). It detects the mutation AFTER the fact and, before aborting: (a)
# restores every protected file from a backup taken when THIS run's snapshot was taken
# (byte-for-byte, NOT `git checkout` — a protected file may already have had a legitimate
# uncommitted edit before this run even started); (b) deletes any NEW file that now matches a
# --protect glob but did not exist at snapshot time, so a fixer cannot dodge the guard by dropping a
# fresh trivially-passing file next to the real protected one; and (c) recomputes each restored
# file's hash and compares it against the ORIGINAL hash recorded before iteration 1 ever ran. The
# per-file sha256 used for BOTH (c) and the live detection in check_protected() is held ONLY in
# loop-fix.sh's own bash process memory (never written to a file) — a --fix subprocess runs as a
# separate CHILD process and structurally cannot write into its parent's shell variables, only into
# files/IPC the parent later reads (issue #34 round-3). Earlier revisions kept this hash in a plain
# file under $LOOP_DIR instead, which the fixer subprocess could reach the same as any other file it
# writes: overwriting it with the hash of its own sabotaged content made detection agree with itself
# ("unchanged"), and simply deleting it was treated as "nothing to protect" — both were a SINGLE-run,
# silent, complete bypass with no PROTECTED-VIOLATION log line at all. That specific file is gone
# now; there is nothing on disk left for a fixer to rewrite to fake a match. The byte-CONTENT backup
# under $PROTECT_BACKUP is different and DOES still live on disk (file content — as opposed to its
# hash — is not something that belongs crammed into a shell variable), so it remains reachable by
# the fixer the same as before: a sufficiently motivated fixer CAN poison the backup copy in the
# same move it poisons the live file — (c) exists to catch exactly that. It is not a tamper-proof
# store; it is a check that notices when the store was tampered with. Whenever a protected file's
# restore cannot be independently verified — the
# restored bytes do NOT match the original hash, the backup copy is missing entirely (e.g. the
# fixer `rm`s it instead of overwriting it with matching content), or the `cp` from backup itself
# fails — loop-fix.sh does NOT claim success: it logs a loud, distinct failure, writes
# $LOOP_DIR/protect-compromised (which file(s), why), and still exits 3. A SUBSEQUENT run then
# refuses to start at all (exit 4) until a human inspects and clears that marker — so the actual
# guarantee is "detect, attempt an exact restore, and if restoration integrity cannot itself be
# verified, refuse future runs until a human clears it," not "always perfectly undoes any sabotage
# no matter how the fixer attacks the backup." Known narrow gap: restore uses `cp -p`, which
# follows a symlink rather than replacing it — if the fixer replaces a protected file with a
# symlink to an external path, the restored bytes land at the symlink's target and the file is
# left as a symlink (content is correct, file type/identity is not) — this does not defeat
# detection or let a rerun report false success, it is a restoration-fidelity gap, not a bypass.
# Round-4 fix: check_protected() now also runs on the PASS path (right before declaring success),
# not just the FAIL path — closing a bypass where a fixer backgrounded a detached mutation timed to
# land after the FAIL-path check but before the next verify call.
#
# Round-5 fix (this revision) — two parts closing the SAME underlying limitation from two angles:
# the fixer runs as `sh -c "$FIX"`, and if $FIX ends with something like "(sleep D;
# corrupt-the-file) & true", that backgrounded subshell is NOT waited on — `sh -c "$FIX"` exits once
# "true" returns, the background job gets reparented away from anything loop-fix.sh can see or wait
# for, and ANY delay D longer than roughly "however long this process takes to finish its own check
# and exit" lands the corruption strictly AFTER that check already ran and reported clean. This is
# NOT a logic bug in check_protected() itself (confirmed correct in isolation) — it is a structural
# property of any short-lived supervisor process: you cannot detect, at the moment you check,
# something that has not happened yet. Adding another check_protected() call at some OTHER point
# does not close this either — the same argument applies to whatever the new "last point" becomes;
# an attacker just increases D further.
#
#   Part 1 — bounded grace-period recheck (check_protected_with_grace(), used on BOTH the PASS path
#   and the FAIL path, replacing the bare check_protected() calls round 4 added): once a
#   check_protected() call comes back clean, sleep a short, bounded grace period (PROTECT_GRACE_SEC,
#   default 1.5s, override via env var LOOP_PROTECT_GRACE_SEC — a test-speed knob) and check ONE
#   more time; a failing recheck is handled exactly like any other violation. This converts "any D
#   beats it" into "D must be under PROTECT_GRACE_SEC to be undetected" — a meaningfully higher bar
#   against realistic reward-hacking, NOT a claim that the gap is closed (see "Honest limit" below).
#
#   Part 2 — the STALLED / BUDGET / watchdog-during-fixer / infra-cap-exhausted abort paths check
#   their OWN abort condition and exit BEFORE that iteration's fixer invocation or the FAIL-path
#   check_protected() call ever runs. A corruption from an EARLIER iteration's still-pending delayed
#   background job can therefore land after every check_protected() call in the run has already
#   completed, and the run exits non-zero — its own real failure code (STALLED stays STALLED, BUDGET
#   stays BUDGET; this is NOT the false-SUCCESS class of bug) — with the protected file left
#   corrupted, unrestored, and unflagged. Each of these paths now also calls
#   check_protected_with_grace() (via check_protected_on_abort()) right before it exits: on a
#   violation it logs a warning, restores from backup, and cleans up any rogue new protect-matching
#   file — the same recovery as a normal violation — but keeps its OWN exit code. This is workspace
#   hygiene on exit, not a re-diagnosis of why the run failed.
#
# Honest limit (read this, it is the actual guarantee): the grace period raises the bar, it does not
# close the gap. A background job whose delay exceeds PROTECT_GRACE_SEC lands strictly after this
# process has finished checking and exited — a structural limit of any short-lived supervisor
# process, not a bug in this specific check, and NOT something a larger grace period alone can ever
# fully close (an attacker can always pick a D larger than whatever finite grace period is set). If
# a caller needs a stronger guarantee against a fixer that deliberately backgrounds long-delayed
# mutations, the fixer's execution environment itself would need to be sandboxed (e.g. no ability to
# survive past the fixer subprocess's own lifetime, via a process-group kill or similar OS-level
# containment) — that is a materially different, larger architectural change and is explicitly out
# of scope for this fix.
# Stall caveat: stall detection is reliable when the verifier emits recognizable failure markers
# or changing pass/fail counts; the hard guarantee against runaway is --max-iter.

# check_protected_with_grace() (issue #34 round-5, Part 1): runs check_protected() first (zero added
# latency when nothing is protected) and, ONLY if something is actually protected, ALSO sleeps
# PROTECT_GRACE_SEC and checks a SECOND time — regardless of whether the first check was clean or
# violated (a violation already returns 1 without paying the sleep; every CLEAN check, which is the
# common case, does pay it — do not read this as "the common case is free"). Exists because
# `sh -c "$FIX"` does not wait on a job the fixer detaches with `&`: a fixer can return immediately
# while a backgrounded subshell mutates a protected file after loop-fix.sh has already moved on to
# its own check. A single check_protected() call, no matter WHERE it runs, can only ever prove
# "clean as of the instant it ran" — it cannot see a mutation that has not happened yet. This
# recheck converts "any delay beats detection" into "the delay must be under PROTECT_GRACE_SEC to be
# undetected" — see the round-5 Guard-scope block above for what this does and does NOT guarantee.
#
# Round-6 adversarial finding: a plain single `sleep "$PROTECT_GRACE_SEC"` is itself a child process
# of loop-fix.sh, and start_watchdog()'s descendant-killer (BAC-626 ③) sends SIGTERM/SIGKILL to
# EVERY child process when an idle/progress timeout fires — including this sleep, if the configured
# watchdog timeout happens to be shorter than PROTECT_GRACE_SEC (an unusual combination, but a real,
# demonstrated one: --idle-timeout-sec below the default recommended 600s). That would silently
# truncate the grace period without ever completing the recheck below. Fix: background the sleep,
# `wait` on it, and check ITS OWN exit status — a `sleep` killed by a signal exits at 128+signum (143
# for SIGTERM, 137 for SIGKILL), a normal uninterrupted sleep exits 0 — and retry the SAME full
# PROTECT_GRACE_SEC duration (not a computed remainder, which would need sub-second wall-clock
# arithmetic `date +%s` cannot provide portably — BSD date has no %N) if it was killed. Bounded to 3
# attempts; the watchdog fires at most once per run and its subshell exits right after its one kill
# sweep (see start_watchdog()), so at most one retry is ever needed in practice.

# Restores every protected file to the bytes captured by snapshot_protected() at run start —

# already have had a legitimate uncommitted edit before this loop-fix run even started, and the

# a modified file (overwrite from backup) and a deleted file (recreate from backup). Always logs
# what happened; a per-file restore failure is logged loudly rather than swallowed, but never
# suppresses the PROTECTED-VIOLATION abort itself (caller still exits 3 regardless).
#
# Round-2 addition (issue #34 adversarial finding 1 — backup poisoning): after copying bytes back,
# recomputes each restored file's sha256 and compares it against the ORIGINAL hash recorded in
# $PROTECT_SNAP_DATA at run start (before iteration 1, so it predates any fixer action including
# poisoning the backup). A mismatch proves $PROTECT_BACKUP was ALSO tampered with — cp'ing from a
# poisoned backup "succeeds" as a copy but does not actually restore anything trustworthy. In that
# case this does NOT log the normal success line; it logs a distinct, loud failure and appends to
# $COMPROMISED_MARKER (consumed by the fail-closed startup check near the top of this script) so a
# later run refuses to proceed rather than trusting a possibly-still-sabotaged workspace.
