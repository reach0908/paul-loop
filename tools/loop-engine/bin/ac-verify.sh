# ac-verify.sh — AC-level success contract gate (ADR-0104, issue #23).
#
# Parses a plan file for one-line AC contracts, runs each contracted AC's `verify:` command
# through verdict-run.sh (the same Verdict Contract producer everything else in this repo
# composes with), checks any `artifacts:`/`expect:` fields, and emits its own top-level VERDICT
# block — so it plugs into whatever already consumes verdict-run.sh's shape (Stop-hook,
# loop-fix.sh) unmodified. This includes ${LOOP_DIR:-.loop}/verdict-state.json — coupled to OUR
# --log-dir via an explicit `export LOOP_DIR="$LOG_DIR"` (see below) so a non-default --log-dir
# isn't silently ignored: each per-AC verdict-run.sh sub-call writes that shared file with ITS OWN
# pass/fail (existing, unmodified last-writer-wins contract). An EXIT trap (armed at the very top
# of the script, before argument parsing even begins, see below) makes one corrective sync call on
# EVERY exit path this script can take — normal completion AND any early exit (usage errors
# including ones during argument parsing itself, a verdict-run.sh exit-2 hit mid-run, or any exit
# path added later) — so it is always the last writer: the true aggregate on
# normal completion, a fail-closed default on any early exit. A Stop-hook-style freshness gate
# reading that file always sees ac-verify.sh's true result for THIS run, never a stale leftover
# from an earlier AC or an earlier unrelated run.
#
# Usage:
#   ac-verify.sh <plan-file> [--log-dir <dir>]
#
# <plan-file> is a markdown (or plain text) file. It is scanned line-by-line for AC lines of the
# form (an optional leading markdown list marker is tolerated):
#
#   AC: <description> | verify: <command> | artifacts: <paths> | expect: <substring>
#   - AC: <description> | verify: <command>
#
# Only `AC: <description>` is required. `verify:`, `artifacts:`, and `expect:` are each optional
# and may appear in any order after the description. One combination is rejected: `expect:` alone,
# with neither `verify:` nor `artifacts:`, has nothing to search (see expect: below). Each field is
# separated from its neighbours by ` | ` (space-pipe-space). An AC line with none of the three
# optional fields is a legitimate, human-readable-only acceptance criterion: it counts as
# `skipped` in the aggregate, not as a failure in itself.
#
# artifacts: delimiter convention — COMMA-separated (`artifacts: path/one, path/two`). Chosen
# over whitespace because paths may themselves contain spaces, and the field is already bounded
# by ` | ` on both sides. Use this convention consistently anywhere plans are authored (see the
# ship-feature SKILL.md step 1 guidance, which quotes this same syntax).
#
# Per contracted AC:
#   - verify:    run via `verdict-run.sh --log <per-AC log> -- sh -c "<command>"` (same
#                `-- sh -c` invocation loop-fix.sh uses). verdict-run.sh's own exit code decides
#                this check: 0 = pass, nonzero = fail — UNLESS verdict-run.sh's own best-effort
#                passed=/failed=/skipped= counts show zero tests actually ran (e.g. a vitest `-t`
#                filter matching zero test titles: exit 0, "0 run"/all-skipped) — that is fail-closed
#                to FAIL too (BAC-837/BAC-1010: a mistyped/drifted filter must not silently PASS).
#                A verdict-run.sh exit of 2 (its own usage-error / fail-closed refusal) is NOT a
#                normal AC failure — it aborts ac-verify.sh itself with exit 2, same as loop-fix.sh's
#                handling of the same case.
#   - artifacts: each comma-separated path must exist, resolved relative to the physical CWD
#                ac-verify.sh itself runs from (NOT the plan file's directory — verify commands
#                and artifacts are expected relative to the repo/worktree root, same as verify
#                commands already are). Absolute paths and parent segments are rejected;
#                symlinks must resolve inside that boundary, including recursive searches.
#   - expect:    a LITERAL substring (`grep -F`, not a regex) that must be found in the AC's
#                corpus. Which corpus depends on what else the AC declares (issue #74):
#                  verify: present         -> the per-AC log (verdict-run.sh's untruncated LOG
#                                             output for that AC). Unchanged, and NOT widened to
#                                             also cover artifacts when both are declared — an
#                                             existing contract must keep meaning what it meant.
#                  no verify:, artifacts:  -> the contents of those artifact files (literal bytes;
#                                             directories are searched recursively). A
#                                             match in ANY listed artifact satisfies it.
#                  neither                 -> a contract error: exit 2, not an AC failure. There is
#                                             no corpus, so the check could never hold; reporting
#                                             that as a violation invites weakening the AC instead
#                                             of fixing the contract.
# An AC is fully PASSED only if every field it declares independently passes. A field that isn't
# present on that AC line is simply not checked (neither pass nor fail).
#
# Fail-closed (modeled directly on require-tests.sh's "0 tests = RED"): if the plan has zero AC
# lines at all, OR has AC lines but zero of them carry any contract field, the overall VERDICT is
# FAIL — a gate that can PASS over zero contracts is exactly the dogfood trap ADR-0104 documents
# (optional fields go unfilled unless something makes zero unacceptable). This does not require
# every AC to have a contract — only that the plan as a whole has at least one.
#
# Exit code: 0 when VERDICT is PASS, 1 when FAIL, 2 on a genuine usage error (missing/unreadable
# plan file, bad flag, or a verdict-run.sh exit-2 encountered mid-run — see above).
#
# bash 3.2 compatible (macOS default). No associative arrays, no ${var,,}, no mapfile/readarray.

# ---- fail-closed corrective verdict-state.json sync via an EXIT trap — armed FIRST, before ANY
# possible exit path (round-3 adversarial finding: the trap used to be registered AFTER the
# argument-parsing while-loop below, so a usage error DURING parsing itself — an unknown flag,
# `--log-dir` given with no value, a stray extra positional argument — called `exit 2` before the
# trap was ever armed, leaving a stale earlier verdict-state.json completely untouched). Nothing
# below this point may run any command that can exit before `trap ... EXIT` on the next line has
# executed — so this block only ever does plain variable assignments and function *definitions*
# (which cannot themselves fail/exit), never a command invocation.
#
# LOG_DIR gets its safe default here (matches verdict-run.sh's own ${LOOP_DIR:-.loop} convention)
# so the trap has a real target even if a usage error strikes before the argument-parsing loop
# below ever runs. That loop still overrides LOG_DIR via --log-dir when given (unchanged), and
# re-derives LOGSUBDIR from the finalized value right after — since the trap's handler reads
# SYNC_LOG (and SYNC_VERDICT_EXIT) at the moment it actually FIRES, not at registration time (bash
# closures over the current value of a global variable), it continues to target wherever LOG_DIR
# ends up being by the time of any given exit, exactly as it already did for the exit paths that
# were already covered.
#
# ac-verify.sh has multiple exit paths — normal completion, usage errors (now including ones
# during argument parsing itself), and a per-AC verdict-run.sh sub-call's own exit-2 refusal
# encountered mid-run (see the header comment, and any exit path added later). A sync call placed
# only at normal completion leaves every early-exit path with whatever an earlier AC's OWN
# sub-call happened to leave in verdict-state.json (last-writer-wins) — a stale, unrelated
# pass/fail for a run that never actually finished. Fixing this per call-site doesn't scale (the
# next new early-exit path reopens the same gap) — so instead ONE trap fires on every exit, no
# matter which code path reaches it, and makes one corrective verdict-run.sh sync call
# (stdout+stderr discarded) whose only purpose is to be the last writer.
#
# SYNC_VERDICT_EXIT starts fail-closed (1 = FAIL) BEFORE the trap is registered — "treat this run
# as failed/incomplete unless proven otherwise". Only the normal-completion path far below (once
# the true aggregate $code has actually been computed) updates SYNC_VERDICT_EXIT to that real
# value, right before the script's final `exit "$code"` — which is what fires the trap. Every
# other exit reaches the trap with the untouched fail-closed default. The handler never calls
# `exit` itself (that would clobber the real exit code this script is trying to return) — it only
# runs its side effect and lets the original exit code propagate.
