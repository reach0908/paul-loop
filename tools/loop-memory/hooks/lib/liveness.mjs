// Liveness ledger — the always-on record that a hook actually fired (paul-loop issue #35).
//
// Why this exists: both hooks are fail-open by contract, so "never fired", "fired and self-gated",
// "fired and legitimately found nothing", and "fired and broke" all present identically to an
// outside observer — exit 0, empty stdout, nothing on disk. The plugin's debug logs
// (LOOP_RECALL_DEBUG / LOOP_GRADUATE_DEBUG) do distinguish them, but they are opt-in and default-off,
// so the *normal* state leaves no trace at all. That is exactly how this plugin's hooks stayed a
// silent no-op for days after a migration dropped their .env loading step: nothing anywhere recorded
// that they had stopped working, and it was found only because a human noticed recall felt absent.
//
// This module makes the distinction verifiable after the fact with nobody having opted into anything:
// one small JSONL line per firing, in loop-engine's existing session-scoped run-ledger
// (`<root>/.loop/runs/<run-id>.jsonl`) and in its exact schema v1 shape
// (`{id, type, ts, aggregate_id, payload, version}`). Reusing that ledger rather than inventing a
// parallel one buys free correlation: a `memory.recall` event lands in the same file, under the same
// run-id, as the `run.started` that opened the session. loop-engine's own fold
// (`bin/run-metrics.mjs`) ignores event types it doesn't know, so co-locating costs it nothing.
// A consuming repo without loop-engine just gets a `.loop/runs/` directory of its own.
//
// ⚠️ Same trust boundary as the rest of that ledger (loop-engine lib/run-ledger.mjs): these files are
// gitignored, unprotected local telemetry and are **forgeable** — anyone with shell access can append
// a line by hand. This proves "a record exists that the hook ran", at the same trust level as any
// other local telemetry; it is not a security signal and must not become a gate input.
//
// Contract (all of it is load-bearing — see test/hooks-liveness.test.ts):
//   1. Never throws. Every failure path returns null. UserPromptSubmit exiting non-zero *discards the
//      user's prompt*, so an instrumentation bug must never be able to reach the process's exit code.
//   2. Never writes to stdout. UserPromptSubmit's stdout IS the context-injection channel.
//   3. Never records secrets or free text. Callers pass counts, booleans, distances, and fixed
//      reason slugs — never the prompt, never note content, never an env value, never an error
//      message (a pg error can carry a connection URL). `scrub()` below is the backstop, not the
//      contract.
//   4. Bounded. One line (<1 KiB) per firing, and the append is skipped entirely once the target run
//      file reaches LOOP_LIVENESS_MAX_BYTES (default 8 MiB). Kill switch: LOOP_LIVENESS_OFF=1.
