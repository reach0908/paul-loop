# paul-loop

A verifier-driven development harness: a common shell/Node core, Claude Code plugins, and reproducibly generated Codex adapters.

## Why

Agentic coding loops fail in a specific, recurring way: the agent decides for itself whether its
own work passed. Self-graded loops drift toward whatever is easiest to claim as done, not what's
actually correct — tests get weakened instead of code getting fixed, "looks right" quietly
substitutes for "is right".

**paul-loop's one invariant: the verifier is the ceiling.** Whatever ground-truth check applies —
a test suite, a type checker, a lint rule, an RLS isolation proof — its exit code is the only thing
that ever produces a verdict. The agent's self-report is not consulted, weighted, or trusted as a
tiebreaker. Everything else this repo ships (verified-fix memory, deterministic risk gating, a
closed verify → fix loop with hard stopping criteria) is built as a consequence of that one rule,
not as a separate feature list.

This is also why the repo ships as **several small plugins instead of one monolith**: you can adopt
the ceiling invariant (`loop-engine`) without also adopting an opinionated delivery workflow
(`ship-flow`) or a semantic-memory database (`loop-memory`). Install only what you're going to use —
`claude plugin details <name>` shows the projected per-plugin token cost before you decide.

> **Source versions:** loop-engine **0.15.0**, ship-flow **0.11.0**, loop-memory **0.7.0**.
> These are source versions, not an assertion about installed caches or published tags. Pre-1.0
> minor versions can change contracts. See [runtime compatibility and migration](docs/runtime-compatibility.md).

For Codex installation without a consumer-specific marketplace, follow the
[generated local marketplace guide](docs/codex-installation.md). For project paths that survive
relocation, use the [portable project launcher and update commands](docs/project-installations.md).
The [release record](docs/audits/2026-09-05-release-results.md) and
[native evaluation report](docs/audits/2026-09-05-native-evaluation.md) distinguish published
artifacts, installed versions, and observed runtime behavior.
The compatibility document's qualification table retains its implementation-time observations;
use those dated reports for subsequent CI, installation and native-session results.

## What's in `loop-engine`

The common execution core. It has no opinions about *how* you deliver work — no issue tracker
integration, no delivery skill, no memory database — only the verify/fix/remember mechanics
underneath one. All commands below live in `tools/loop-engine/bin/` and are automatically added to
`PATH` by Claude Code when the plugin loads. Codex and plain shell consumers use an explicit
`pluginBinPrefix` or absolute paths; do not assume native PATH registration there.

### `verdict-run.sh` — wrap any verify command in a machine-readable contract

Everything downstream (`loop-fix`, lesson recording, CI) reads this contract, not raw stdout, so one
format has to hold for pytest, vitest, `go test`, a shell script, anything with an exit code.

```bash
verdict-run.sh -- pnpm test
verdict-run.sh --log /tmp/run.log --max-fails 10 -- pnpm typecheck
verdict-run.sh --guard-mutation -- pnpm verify   # fail the verdict if verify mutates tracked files
```

```
=== VERDICT ===
VERDICT: PASS
EXIT: 0
SUMMARY: passed= failed= skipped= duration_ms=8
LOG: /path/to/.loop/last-run.log
=== END VERDICT ===
```

- `VERDICT`/`EXIT` come straight from the wrapped command's exit code — never inferred from output.
- `SUMMARY` is best-effort count extraction (jest/vitest/pytest/`node --test` formats); it never
  changes the verdict, only helps a reader triage faster.
- On `FAIL`, greppable `FAIL: ...` lines are pulled from the log (curated markers: `✕`, `not ok`,
  `AssertionError`, `panic:`, etc.) so an LLM reading the block steers instead of drowning in a raw
  stack trace.
- `--guard-mutation` snapshots git-visible workspace state before/after and forces `FAIL` if verify
  itself changed tracked files — closes the "the fix mutated the test instead of the code" hole.
- The full doc, including the wire format other tools can rely on, is in
  [`docs/verdict-contract.md`](tools/loop-engine/docs/verdict-contract.md).

### `loop-fix.sh` — a closed verify → fix → re-verify loop with hard stopping criteria

```bash
loop-fix.sh --verify "pnpm test" --fix "claude -p 'fix the failing test'" --max-iter 8
loop-fix.sh --verify "pnpm typecheck" --stall 3 --infra-retries 2 --budget-sec 900
```

- **Generator ≠ evaluator**: the `--fix` command never decides success; only `--verify`'s exit code
  (via `verdict-run.sh`) does.
- **Hard stops, not vibes**: `--max-iter` (always on), `--budget-sec` (wall clock), `--stall`
  (aborts once the failure signature repeats N times *and* pass/fail counts stop moving — a moving
  count is treated as progress even with an identical error message).
- **Infra failures don't burn the iteration budget**: a docker-daemon/port-down signature with no
  actual test-runner failure marker is exempt (`--infra-retries`, default 2) instead of counting
  against `--max-iter` or polluting the lessons store.
- **No reward hacking**: pair with `--guard-mutation` on the underlying verify command so a "fix"
  that edits the test instead of the code gets caught, not rewarded.
- Every iteration writes a structured handoff to `.loop/` (`$LOOP_PROMPT_FILE`, `$LOOP_VERDICT_FILE`,
  `$LOOP_LOG_FILE`) that the `--fix` command can read — wrap `claude -p` for a real agentic fixer, or
  a deterministic script for tests.

### `lessons.mjs` — record only what a verifier actually confirmed, recall it next time

```bash
lessons.mjs record --signature "FAIL: ..." --verified --fix "..." --title "..." --lessons .loop/lessons
lessons.mjs recall  --signature "FAIL: ..." --lessons .loop/lessons
lessons.mjs promote --min-count 3 --lessons .loop/lessons          # recurring candidates
lessons.mjs challenge --id <key> --verdict accept|reject --reason "..."   # separate skeptical pass
lessons.mjs promote --codify --lessons .loop/lessons               # ONLY accepted candidates, fail-closed
lessons.mjs retire --id <key> --ref "docs/where-this-got-codified.md"
```

- A lesson is written only when a **verifier**, not the fixer's own claim, confirmed the fix worked.
  Unverified self-reports are never treated as authoritative on recall.
- `recall` matches on failure signature first, with room for semantic recall on top (see
  [`docs/lessons.md`](tools/loop-engine/docs/lessons.md)).
- Promotion is a two-step, two-party protocol: `promote` surfaces *candidates* (recurring ≥ N
  times); a separate `challenge` pass — deliberately not the same judgement that proposed the
  candidate — has to `accept` before `--codify` will ever emit it. No accept, no codification;
  the codify path fails closed.
- `retire` is terminal: only an accepted+codified lesson can retire, so it stops resurfacing once
  it's already living in a guideline/skill.

### `classify-risk.mjs` / `gate.mjs` — deterministic risk gating, not agent self-scoring

The problem this closes: an agent that scores its own blast radius turns a safety gate into
decoration. So the dimensions are derived from the **change itself** — file paths touched,
commands run, the pipeline stage — and an agent may only ever *escalate* a dimension, never
soften one below what the rules already derived:

```
final(dimension) = max(rule(dimension), agent(dimension))
```

```bash
classify-risk.mjs --from-git --stage pr --action "PR against main"
classify-risk.mjs --from-git --stage implement \
  --agent-blast-radius high --agent-reversibility partial   # can only raise, never lower
gate.mjs --blast-radius high --reversibility partial --cost low
```

- Exit codes are the contract: `0` = AUTO, `10` = REQUIRE (a human has to approve before this runs —
  fires whenever reversibility is `none` *or* any dimension is left unset: unknown fails closed,
  never silently AUTO), `11` = DENY_AND_LOG (reversible but broad/expensive — denied by default,
  with the verdict evidence attached for a human to review later, not blocked on waiting for one),
  `2` = usage error.
- `--render-md` emits one PR-body-ready markdown block with a greppable
  `<!-- gate-verdict: ... -->` marker, so the routing decision has a durable, auditable trail
  instead of living only in a terminal that scrolled away.
- `classify-risk.mjs` computes dimensions and then execs `gate.mjs` — there is exactly one place
  that turns dimensions into a routing decision, not two copies that can drift.
- **The path/command rule table ships empty.** Which paths are a migration, which are auth, which
  are the CI pipeline itself — that's domain knowledge specific to *your* repo, not something a
  portable plugin should hardcode. Point `--rules <path>` (or `CLASSIFY_RISK_RULES`, or drop a
  `risk-rules.json` at your repo root) at your own rule table:
  ```json
  { "pathRules": [{ "id": "db-migration", "startsWith": ["db/migrations/"],
                     "dims": { "revers": "none" }, "deep": ["your-migration-check"],
                     "why": "an applied migration cannot be undone" }],
    "commandRules": [{ "id": "cmd-deploy", "patterns": ["\\bdeploy\\b"],
                        "dims": { "revers": "none" }, "why": "running this changes shared state" }] }
  ```
  With no rules file at all, structural baselines still apply (docs-only and small-changeset AUTO,
  many-files escalates, merge/deploy/send are always a human decision) — the tool is usable before
  you've written a single rule, it just won't know your repo's specific danger zones yet.

### `require-tests.sh` — a verifier that runs zero tests must go RED, not vacuously green

```bash
require-tests.sh "*.integration.test.ts" "RLS isolation proof"
```

Put this before a test runner on any step whose entire purpose is to *prove* something. If the
tests that prove it were deleted, or never written, `vitest --passWithNoTests`-style flags would
happily exit `0` over nothing — this guard turns that into an explicit `FAILED:` line instead.

## What's in `loop-memory`

**Opt-in** (`defaultEnabled: false` — install it, then `claude plugin enable loop-memory@paul-loop`).
It's a database dependency (pgvector-enabled Postgres), not core loop mechanics, so it doesn't ride
along with `loop-engine`/`ship-flow`. It gives verified lessons semantic recall — instead of a
grep-shaped `.loop/lessons` directory, a `UserPromptSubmit` hook embeds the current prompt and
injects the lessons (and, if configured, ADR/glossary/research knowledge) that are semantically
closest to it.

Two hook programs handle three events. Optional memory failures do not block a prompt or session;
liveness records distinguish missing configuration, empty results, and failed work:

- **`SessionStart` / `SessionEnd` → `graduate`** — copies verified lessons from `.loop/lessons` (loop-engine's own
  convention) into the pgvector store, idempotently (already-graduated lessons are skipped by id).
- **`UserPromptSubmit` → `recall`** — embeds the prompt, pulls the semantically-closest verified
  lessons (and configured knowledge, if any) back out, and injects them as `<past-lessons
  untrusted="true">` / `<knowledge untrusted="true">` context blocks — explicitly framed as
  reference data, not instructions, as defense in depth against prompt injection via stored notes.

Configure it with `claude plugin install loop-memory@paul-loop --config KEY=value` (repeatable) or
interactively via `/plugin configure loop-memory@paul-loop`:

| Key | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `openai_api_key` / `gemini_api_key` | no (but you need at least one) | `sensitive: true` — stored in the OS keychain / `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, never in `settings.json`. Without either key both hooks no-op. |
| `loop_database_url` | no | Defaults to `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5434/loop_memory` — this plugin's `docker-compose.yml` matches that default (`docker compose up -d --wait` from `tools/loop-memory/`). |
| `loop_memory_signing_key` | no | HMAC-SHA256 key required for store writes and recall, including knowledge. Missing configuration fails closed — see "Threat model" below. `sensitive: true`. |
| `loop_dotenv_path` | no | Repo-relative (or absolute) dotenv-shaped file the hooks read **before** their key gate. Default `.loop/.env`. See "Keys that live in a `.env`" below. |
| `loop_adr_dir` / `loop_context_file` / `loop_research_dir` / `loop_design_dir` | no | Optional *knowledge* corpus sources (separate from lessons) — a directory of `# ADR-NNNN: Title`-headed decision docs, a single `**Term**:`-chunked glossary file, and two `##`-section-chunked doc directories, respectively. Unset = that source is skipped entirely; nothing is assumed about your repo's docs unless you point at them. |
| `loop_embed_provider` / `loop_embed_model` | no | Explicit provider/model selection; provider is required when both API keys are set. Identity changes require deliberate reindexing. |
| `loop_recall_max_distance` / `loop_knowledge_max_distance` | no | Cosine-distance cutoffs (0=identical..2=opposite) for the lessons and knowledge corpora respectively — a hit farther than this is dropped instead of injected. **Embedder-dependent**, calibrate for your provider/corpus; the code default (0.65) is a loose safety net if left unset. |

### Keys that live in a `.env`

Claude Code hands a hook the **session process env** — it does not load `.env` files. A repo that
keeps its embedding key in a gitignored `.env` and never `export`s it to the shell would therefore
trip both hooks' own no-key gate and no-op *silently*: no recall, no graduation, no error. So the
hooks load a dotenv-shaped file themselves, before that gate:

- **Path**: `loop_dotenv_path` (default `.loop/.env`, repo-relative; absolute paths work too). If
  your key is at, say, `packages/loop-memory/.env`, set the option — the default is a guess, not a
  discovery mechanism.
- **Precedence**: session env > `userConfig` > file. A key already set is never overwritten.
- **Worktree fallback**: a gitignored `.env` doesn't exist in a freshly-created feature worktree —
  which is exactly where an isolated agent loop runs. If the path is missing there, the *main*
  worktree's copy is read instead (resolved via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`). Nothing is
  copied; the key stays untracked and in one place.
- **Best-effort**: a missing/unreadable file, or a non-git directory, leaves the env untouched and
  the hooks fall back to their normal fail-open no-op.

Only the allowlist is loaded: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `LOOP_MEMORY_SIGNING_KEY`,
`LOOP_DATABASE_URL`, `LOOP_EMBED_PROVIDER`, `LOOP_EMBED_MODEL`, `LOOP_RECALL_MAX_DISTANCE`, and
`LOOP_KNOWLEDGE_MAX_DISTANCE`. Shell control variables and guard-off switches are ignored.
The CLI and hooks share precedence: explicit session env (including an empty value) > Claude
`userConfig` bridge > allowlisted file. Codex uses explicit env/file configuration; its package does
not claim Claude's native configuration UI or secret storage.

### Liveness — proving the hooks actually fired

Fail-open is what keeps a broken memory store from breaking your session, and it is also what makes a
broken hook invisible: *never fired*, *fired and self-gated*, *fired and found nothing close enough*,
and *fired and broke* all look the same from outside (exit 0, empty stdout, nothing on disk). These
hooks once stayed a silent no-op for days for exactly that reason, and it was caught only because
someone noticed recall felt absent.

So every firing appends one small JSONL line — always on, nothing to enable — to `loop-engine`'s
session run ledger at `<repo>/.loop/runs/<run-id>.jsonl`, in its schema v1 shape, as
`memory.recall` / `memory.graduate`:

```json
{"id":"…","type":"memory.recall","ts":"2026-08-24T15:13:05.700Z","aggregate_id":"<session-id>","version":1,
 "payload":{"outcome":"no_match","reason":"above_cutoff","key":true,"dotenv":true,"prompt_chars":47,
            "lessons":{"candidates":3,"near":0,"nearest":0.71},"knowledge":{"candidates":0,"near":0,"nearest":null},
            "cutoffs":{"lessons":0.65,"knowledge":0.65},"injected_chars":0,"ms":812}}
```

`outcome` is `injected` | `no_match` | `skipped` | `error`, and `reason` says which gate or failure
(`no_embedding_key`, `recall_off`, `prompt_too_short`, `stdin_parse_fail`, `no_hits`, `above_cutoff`,
`cli_failed`, `exception`). "Never fired" is the absence of all of them. Only counts, booleans,
distances and fixed slugs are ever written — never your prompt, note content, an env value, a
resolved dotenv path, or an error message.

Read it back with a command that needs neither the database nor a key:

```bash
# Resolve the actual memory artifact first; no bare `loop-memory` executable is shipped.
MEMORY_ROOT=$(node "$LOOP_ENGINE_PATH/bin/plugin-path.mjs" resolve loop-memory)
node "$MEMORY_ROOT/dist/cli.js" liveness --root "$PWD"
node "$MEMORY_ROOT/dist/cli.js" liveness --root "$PWD" --json
node "$MEMORY_ROOT/dist/cli.js" liveness --root "$PWD" --assert
```

`--assert` deliberately treats self-gating and honest misses as evidence of life — a check that
alarms on a legitimately empty corpus is a check nobody keeps. Tuning: `LOOP_LIVENESS_OFF=1` disables
the record entirely, `LOOP_LIVENESS_MAX_BYTES` (default 8 MiB) caps how large a run file it will keep
appending to.

⚠️ Like the rest of that ledger, these files are gitignored, unprotected local telemetry and are
**forgeable** by anyone with shell access. Treat them as observability, never as a gate input.

### Threat model — write-path provenance

A persistent, semantically-searched memory store is a stored-prompt-injection target: anything that
can write a convincing-looking note can get it replayed into a future session as "context". The
`graduate` path validates lesson evidence and source state before ingestion. Store notes carry an
HMAC envelope binding repository owner, corpus, source, embedding identity and content hash.
This applies to knowledge as well as lessons. Missing keys, incompatible ownership/embedding
identity and invalid signatures fail closed. Older unsigned or differently bound rows need a
reviewed migration/reindex; they are not silently adopted.

A valid HMAC establishes the configured store write path, not that a lesson is true. Processes with
the signing key can produce signatures. Evidence receipts are local guardrails and must match the
current workspace; they are not cryptographic proof of independent evaluation. Recalled content
remains explicitly untrusted context.

### CLI

The hooks call a single bundled entry point (`dist/cli.js`, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/cli.js` once
installed) — dependency-free, no `node_modules` needed at runtime, same "ships as a script" shape as
`loop-engine`'s `bin/`. You can also run it by hand for manual recall/graduate/inspection:

```bash
node dist/cli.js graduate --lessons .loop/lessons [--knowledge <adrDir>] [--context <file>] [--research <dir>] [--design <dir>]
node dist/cli.js recall (--query "<text>" | --query-file <f>) [--k N] [--json]
node dist/cli.js stats [--json]   # read-only store summary, no embedder/key needed
```

Both `graduate` and `recall` refuse to run against a stub embedder by default if no
`OPENAI_API_KEY`/`GEMINI_API_KEY` is set (`--allow-stub` overrides, for offline manual wiring
checks) — a store built with a real embedder queried with a stub one returns results that look
valid but are meaningless, not an empty/obviously-wrong result.

## Runtime capabilities

| Capability | Claude Code | Generated Codex | Plain shell / other agents |
|---|---|---|---|
| Verify/fix, risk, lesson and evidence CLI | Common core | Common core | Common core |
| Skills | Native | Agent Skills with a visible runtime contract | Instructions only |
| Separate review agents | Native agent definitions | Role skills plus reviewed project-agent templates | Caller supplies isolation |
| Workflow JS | Native host feature when enabled | Documented equivalent fallback where independence and gates are preserved | Caller supplies a driver |
| Protection / Stop hooks | Requires enabled host hooks | Requires host hook trust; patch paths adapted, `ask` becomes `deny` | No automatic host hooks |
| Native hard cancellation | Host capability, not attested | Not claimed | Caller responsibility |

Generated packages and fixture passes do not prove installation, activation, trust, isolation, or
live end-to-end behavior. See [the detailed matrix and test boundaries](docs/runtime-compatibility.md).

## Install (Claude Code)

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add reach0908/paul-loop
claude plugin install loop-engine@paul-loop
# loop-memory installs disabled (defaultEnabled:false) — install, configure, then enable:
claude plugin install loop-memory@paul-loop --config openai_api_key=sk-...
# (or configure interactively later, inside a session: /plugin configure loop-memory@paul-loop)
claude plugin enable loop-memory@paul-loop
```

## Generate reviewable runtime packages

```bash
node scripts/refresh-skill-lock.mjs --check
node scripts/generate-runtime-packages.mjs
node scripts/generate-runtime-packages.mjs --check
```

This writes only `build/runtime-packages/`: separate Claude/Codex marketplace roots, native
manifests, adapters, role templates, dependency metadata, and a content/mode inventory with source
provenance. It neither installs nor trusts anything. Existing `zine-codex` derivatives stay separate.
Follow the [explicit resolver and migration contract](docs/runtime-compatibility.md#installation-resolution)
before using an artifact; package version equality alone does not establish runtime equality.

## Try it without installing anything

`--plugin-dir` loads a plugin for one session only — no marketplace registration needed. Useful for
trying it against a clone, or for developing this repo itself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reach0908/paul-loop
claude --plugin-dir paul-loop/tools/loop-engine
# inside the session, bin/ is already on PATH:
#   verdict-run.sh -- echo hi
```

## Repo layout

```

`tools/loop-engine` (not `plugins/loop-engine`) is not a style choice — this plugin was extracted
from a monorepo where its own test suite hardcodes that relative path three levels up from
`test/`. Renaming the directory would have meant "unmodified migration" was no longer true, so the
path stayed.

## Development status

- **Public.** M0 removed everything that only made sense inside the origin monorepo: one hook with
  an external import, tests that assert on that repo's own CI/hook wiring, and a fixture file that
  carried real (if scrubbed-of-secrets) PR titles and file paths from a production codebase. What's
  left is intended to run standalone. Current checks, not the historical migration test count,
  determine whether the current source passes.
- CI runs engine regressions, memory unit/type checks, committed bundle drift checks and schema
  validation. Packaging portability covers Linux/macOS and Node 22/24; Claude schema checks use
  2.1.261 plus a latest-version canary. Generated Codex packages have contract/adapter fixtures;
  no model-backed native E2E run is implied. Docker integration remains a separate check.
- `tag on publish` depends on engine, memory, runtime and secret-scan jobs for the same event SHA,
  with write permission confined to the tag job on main. It pushes only newly created tag refs.
  Editing these workflows does not run a release or establish the remote's branch protection.
- **Versioning: explicit semver, not a floating SHA channel.** Claude Code's own version-resolution
  order (see [Plugins reference § Version management](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference#version-management))
  falls back to "update whenever the resolved commit changes" only when `version` is omitted from
  both `plugin.json` and the marketplace entry — the docs call that the right fit for "internal or
  team plugins under active development", and explicit version bumps the right fit for "published
  plugins with stable release cycles". M1 is the latter. It also resolves a real tooling conflict:
  `claude plugin validate --strict` (wired into CI above) treats a missing `version` as a hard error,
  not just a warning — so "omit version" and "keep `--strict` in CI" cannot both hold. Bump `version`
  in `plugin.json` and the catalog for a release; the dependent tag workflow creates missing
  `<plugin>--v<version>` tags after validation. Updating an installed plugin is a separate action.

## Milestones

- **M0 (done)** — private scaffold: secrets/PII sweep, gitleaks CI, `loop-engine` bin + tests
  migrated unmodified, `claude plugin validate --strict` green, one dogfooded `verdict-run` via
  `--plugin-dir`.
- **M1 (done)** — public release of `loop-engine`: English docs for the remaining Korean-language
  prose in `docs/` (done), `classify-risk`'s rule table externalized so a consumer can supply their
  own via `--rules`/`CLASSIFY_RISK_RULES`/a `risk-rules.json` at their repo root (done), repository
  flipped private → public on explicit semver (see [Development status](#development-status) for why
  not a SHA channel).
- **M2 (done)** — `ship-flow` (the delivery-loop skill stack) + `templates/` (constitution-layer
  templates a setup skill wires into a consuming repo — a plugin's root `CLAUDE.md` is not loaded as
  project context by Claude Code, so this can't just be a file sitting in the plugin).
- **M3 (in progress, optional)** — `loop-memory` (pgvector semantic lesson recall, opt-in /
  `defaultEnabled: false` — scaffold done, this section documents it) and a submission to
  `anthropics/claude-plugins-community` (still open — a human decision, not made in this repo).
